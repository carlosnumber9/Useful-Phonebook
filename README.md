# Useful Phonebook
Code test for ShuttleCloud Corp

This is a miniapp used as a code test for Email Meter. To run this app, type in terminal:
`
npm run phonebook-start
`

It shows two pages:
- A list with all contacts
- A detail view with information about a single contact

For the contact list data, this app uses a pseudo-persistence based on the NPM package `json-server`, which runs a REST server over a JSON file conceived as a local database.
Random data will be generated once the user chooses the option in the main page.
